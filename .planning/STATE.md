## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Refactor]: User-provided API key (client-side only) — no server needed, each user brings their own Anthropic account
- [Refactor]: Single Claude call for search + translate — faster cycle (<8s), simpler, avoids double-billing
- [Refactor]: Preserve existing deduplication, Service Worker, and PWA manifest; restructure don't rewrite
- [Refactor]: Remove Gemini backend proxy entirely; Vercel serves static assets only post-refactor

### Pending Todos
